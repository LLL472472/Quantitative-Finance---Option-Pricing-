# Quantitative-Finance---Option-Pricing-

Applied Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in an examination of three distinct pricing strategies. These strategies included the BlackScholes formula, Monte Carlo simulation for European options, and Monte Carlo simulation for Barrier Knock-in options. This analytical approach
facilitated an in-depth comparative analysis, contributing to the refinement and optimization of our pricing methodologies.

Increased pricing accuracy, resulting in a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) reduction of 0.25, aligning more closely with Black-Scholes models.
